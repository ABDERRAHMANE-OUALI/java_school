# Try Out Development Containers: Java

This is a sample project to go along with the "try" quick start for the **[VS Code Remote - Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers)** extension.

**If you aren't already following the quick start, [see here](#setting-up-the-development-container).**

## Things to try

One you have this sample opened in a container, you can work with it just as you would locally. Here's a few things to try:

1. **Edit:**
   1. Open `src\main\java\com\mycompany\app\App.java`
   2. Try adding some code and check out the language features.
2. **Terminal:** Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> and type `uname` and or other Linux commands from the terminal window.
3. **Build, Run, and Debug:**
   1. Open `src\main\java\com\mycompany\app\App.java`
   2. Add a breakpoint.
   3. Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch the app in the container.
   4. Once the breakpoint is hit, try hovering over variables, examining locals, and more.
4. **Run a Test:**
   1. Open `src\main\java\com\mycompany\app\AppTest.java`
   2. Put a breakpoint in a test.
   3. Click the Debug Test in the Code Lens above the function and watch it hit the breakpoint.

## Setting up the development container

Follow these steps to open this sample in a container:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) to get set up.

2. If you're not yet in a development container, press <kbd>F1</kbd>, run the **Remote-Container: Open Folder in Container...** command, and select a cloned copy of this repository.

3. Selected cloned copy of this folder, wait for the container to start, and try things out!
